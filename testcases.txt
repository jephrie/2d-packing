// Packed rectangle is completely encapsulated and appears in a corner of a free rectangle
given a rectangle F of size 10x10 (w x h)
and a rectangle R of size 5x5
and R is packed to the bottom left, coords (0,5), of F
when a maximal rectangle split is performed on F
then F is split in to a 10x5 and 5x10 rectangle originating at coords (0,0), (5,0) respectively
