# 2d-packing
## Synopsis
The goal of this project is to allow a user to define a bin and many boxes to pack into it. As bins are filled, additional bins are created and subsequent boxes will be packed into available bins. This app will use the maximal rectangle algorithm (best short side fit) to determine the placement and orientation of the packed boxes.
